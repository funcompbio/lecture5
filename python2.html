## Vectors

* A vector, or [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) is a
type of object (variable) that can store more than one single value and allows for an
indexed access to its values.

* We can set a constant vector into a Python variable using an assignment:

```
v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

* We can access its values by referring to one of its **valid positions** in the vector.

* Given a vector with $n$ elements, the **valid positions** of a vector in Python (and
in many other programming languages) go from 0 to $n-1$, that is, positions follow a
[zero-based numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering).

## Vectors

* Given the vector:

```
v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

* To access the values of `v` using one of its **valid positions**, we will
use the notation `v[i]`, where `i` is a **valid position**, for instance:

```
print(v[0])
v[0]+v[1]
i=4
v[i]
v[i-1]
```

* Vectors are containers for sequences of values contiguous in memory.

* Vectors in programming are analogous to vectors in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_%28mathematics_and_physics%29).

* Filling up vectors with values enables re-using algorithms that operate
on the vector space. This requires looping over valid positions of a vector.

---

## Looping over valid positions

* Using an iterative statement, we generate a sequence of valid positions of
vector that enable looping over valid positions and consequently the access
to their associated values.

.left-column[
  <pre>
  v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
  i = 0
  s = 0

  while (i < 10) :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;s = s + v[i]
  &nbsp;&nbsp;i = i + 1

  print(s)
  </pre>
]

.right-column[
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

]

## Looping over valid positions

* Assume we have in the vector `v` a DNA sequence and we want to count
how many nucleotides `T` we have in this sequence.

  <pre>
  v = ['A', 'T', 'T', 'G', 'C', 'C', 'T', 'A']
  i = 0
  n = 0

  while (i < 8) :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;if (v[i] == 'T') :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n = n + 1
  &nbsp;&nbsp;i = i + 1

  print("there are %d nucleotides T" %(n))
  </pre>

---

## Compound conditionals

* Let's say we want to count the number of dinucleotides `TT` in the
DNA sequence. This requires comparing two consecutive positions in the
vector, both of which should have the nucleotide `T`.

* We can always implement a more complex logic by nesting
[conditional statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_%28computer_programming%29).
However, we can write more compact code with compound conditionals using
[logical operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective).

* In Python we have the following three logical operators:

|   Operator          |  Type          | Description                   |
|-------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------|
|   _cond1_ `and` _cond2_   |  conjunction   | True if both operands are true|
|   _cond1_ `or` _cond2_    |  disjunction   | True if either operand is true|
|   `not` _cond_          |  negation      | True if operand is false      |

* Here _cond_, _cond1_ and _cond2_ refer to logical conditions such as:

```
a == 2
v[i] eq 'T'
i < 10
```

---

## Compound conditionals

* We can implement the Python program that counts dinucleotides `TT` as follows:
                                                     
  <pre>
  v = ['A', 'T', 'T', 'G', 'C', 'C', 'T', 'A']
  i = 1
  n = 0

  while (i < 8) :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;if (v[i] == 'T' and v[i-1] == 'T') :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n = n + 1
  &nbsp;&nbsp;i = i + 1

  print("there are %d dinucleotides TT" %(n))
  </pre>

---

## Concluding remarks

* Vectors allow one to store multiple values in a single variable.

* Values in a vector are accessed by their position in the vector.

* Valid positions in a vector in Python start at 0 and consequently end
at the number of elements minus one.

* Looping over valid positions enables developing algorithms that
can be re-used by replacing the values of the vector.
